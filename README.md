Hello to everyone reading this i made a Hangman game with sound! 
this is one of few scripts i made in my personal time so i'm pretty proud of it 
it's rough around the edges but i will try to update and change things where ever i can
in it's current state it might not work because the path was hard coded to configure to mine but that is something i will fix in a future update
